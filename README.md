# FizzBuzz with Tests

## My Process
- Firstly, I began to write each test and pass the test with a simple solution.
- Once I had a solution for all 4 tests, I then changed the code from an If statement to a Case for practice.
- Finally, I refactored the code into a 1 line elsif statement.

## Learnings
- I brushed up on my Ruby skills and learned how to refactor an elsif statement into a single line of code.

## Technologies Used
